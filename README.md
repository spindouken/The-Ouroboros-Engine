THE OUROBOROS ENGINE

Taglines:
"A council that eats its own errors to birth perfection."
"Creation through destruction. Perfection through recursion."
"Iterative Refinement: Most AI workflows are linear (Input -> Output). Ouroboros is circular and self-referential, which is the only way to achieve high-fidelity results without human hand-holding."
