# ♾️ TL;DR USER GUIDE: THE OUROBOROS ENGINE (V2.99 MVP)

> **"A council that eats its own errors to birth perfection."**

This is not a coding agent. This is an **Architectural Specification Engine**.
It doesn't write your code; it writes the *perfect plan* so a coding agent (Cursor/Windsurf/Cline) can build it without thinking.

## 🧠 The Soul of the Machine (Philosophy)

Ouroboros rejects "AI Consensus" (which is usually just shared hallucination). It is built on **Adversarial Engineering**.

1.  **Conflict > Consensus:** We don't ask 3 agents to agree. We ask 1 agent to **prove the others wrong**.
2.  **State > Memory:** The "Blackboard" is a **Living Constitution**. Once a decision is made (e.g., "Use PostgreSQL"), it is legally binding for all future agents.
3.  **Atomic Bricks:** We don't generate "Apps." We generate tiny, verified **Bricks**. If one fails, we replace it. The Factory never stops.

## 🚀 The Workflow (How to Pilot)

### PHASE 1: THE ORACLE (The Interview)
*   **Goal:** Turn your vague idea into a "Project Bible."
*   **Action:** Click the **Crystal Ball**.
*   **Don't say:** "Build a twitter clone."
*   **Do say:** "I need a scalable architecture for a micro-blogging platform focusing on high-ingest rates."
*   **Magic:** The Oracle will grill you with questions. Answer them. Then click **"Perform Context Fusion"**.

### PHASE 2: GENESIS (The Constitution)
*   **Goal:** Establish the Laws.
*   **Action:** The system generates a `Constitution`.
*   **Conflict Check:** If you asked for "Python" but selected a "React Template," the engine will stop you.
*   **Pro Tip:** Add `NEGATIVE CONSTRAINT: DO NOT USE TAILWIND` in your prompt to force specific exclusions.

### PHASE 3: THE PRISM (The Decomposer)
*   **Goal:** Break the project into ~20-50 Atomic Tasks.
*   **Action:** The Prism classifies your domain (e.g., "FinTech," "Game Dev") and spawns a **Council of Specialists**.
*   **Your Job:** Review the Task List. Toggle OFF anything you don't need.

### PHASE 4: THE FACTORY (Production)
*   **Goal:** Execute the plan, one Brick at a time.
*   **The Loop:**
    1.  **Specialist:** Writes the spec.
    2.  **Reflexion:** Critiques itself immediately.
    3.  **Surveyor:** Checks for "AI Slop" (hedging, refusals).
    4.  **Antagonist:** Tries to destroy the brick with logic.
    5.  **Masonry:** If it survives, it is cemented into the `Session Codex`.

## 🎛️ The Controls (How to Tune)

### 🚩 Red Flagging (The Bouncer)
*   **What it does:** Kills any output containing "I think," "maybe," or "TODO."
*   **Advice:** **ALWAYS ON.** Prevents sycophancy.

### 🎭 Antagonist Protocol (The "Mean Reviewer")
*   **What it does:** Explicitly tries to reject work.
*   **Advice:**
    *   **Strict Mode:** For Core Architecture.
    *   **Lax Mode:** For simple content generation.

### 👥 Council Size
*   **Small (3):** Faster, focused.
*   **Large (10):** Detailed, expensive.

## 💡 Troubleshooting "The Ghost in the Machine"

*   **"All Heads Severed"**:
    *   Your API Key is dead/limited. Check `Settings -> Model Configuration`.
*   **"The Loop of Death" (Reject -> Repair -> Reject)**:
    *   The Antagonist is too strict for the model. **Lower Antagonist settings** or **Increase Model Intelligence** (switch to Sonnet/GPT-4).
*   **"Zero Tasks Generated"**:
    *   JSON parse error. **Refresh the Page**. State is saved in IndexedDB; a refresh clears the bad context.

## ⚠️ Important Note on V2.99
This is the **MVP Stable Release**.
Some features mentioned in the Atlas (Time Travel, Advanced Memory) are currently in the **V3.0 Roadmap**.
Focus on the **Core Loop** (Oracle -> Prism -> Factory). It is rock solid.
